# SKFBOT

### Introduction
skfbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you write a script which will help your gitter bot to take the user
input as well as give him the relevant response.


### Where to Check:
You can check this bot on gitter.im in the following lobbies:

**SKF-Gitter_chatbot/Lobby**

### The script for hubot is being written in Coffee-Script.

You can check the example.coffee

Here,
```
robot.hear /(.*)/i, (res) -> 
         ques = res.match[1]; 
```

This snippet is used for reading the user input from gitter and assigning it to the variable ques.
But this snippet has a drawback it will listen to everything like if in ithe lobby you talk to other people then it will start responding automatically.

For, resolving that issue that it only listens when we refer it change the code snippet with following: 

```
robot.hear /@skfchatbot (.*)/i, (res)->
           ques = res.match[1]; 
```
Here, write the name *@skfchatbot* for so that it will only listen when is name is being called.
```
   res.send "msg"
```

This one is used for sending back the response to the user.
