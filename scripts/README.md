# SKFBOT

### Introduction
skfbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you write a script which will help your gitter bot to take the user
input as well as give him the relevant response.
